Calculate how many increments/decrements by 1 are needed to make a given array constant.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In one step, any element of a given array can be either increased or decreased by 1.

Write a function:
  class Solution { public int solution(int[] A); }

that, given an array A of N integers, returns the minimum number of steps required to make all elements equal.

Examples:
  1. Given A = [3, 2, 1, 1, 2, 3, 1], the function should return 5. All 1s can be increased by 1 and all 3s can be decreased by 1.
  2. Given A = [4, 1, 4, 1], the function should return 6. All 4s can be decreased by 1 three times.
  3. Given A = [3, 3, 3], the function should return 0. All elements are already the same.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:
* N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
* each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..4].
